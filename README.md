# Stoic Quote Machine
This is a little react project made with react for the FreeCodeCamp certification : Front End Development Libraries üë©‚Äçüéì

Ps: The use of react is absolutely unnecessary for this project, I mainly used it for practice and the  FreeCodeCamp certification.

# Scrapping
I personalized my project by making a JSON file with quotes from some famous Stoic thinkers, after scrapping them with NodeJs from the website goodreads.com using this little tool:  [goodreads-quote-scraper](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I also used a little bit of Bootstrap, and [react-icons] (https://github.com/react-icons/react-icons) to replace Font Awesome.
