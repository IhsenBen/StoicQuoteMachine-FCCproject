Show that through them you have learned to think better, to be a more discriminating and reflective person. Books are the training weights of the mind. They are very helpful, but it would be a bad mistake to suppose that one has made progress simply by having internalized their contents.","author":"Epictetus"},{"quote":"First say to yourself what you would be;\\nand then do what you have to do.","author":"Epictetus"},{"quote":"It\'s not what happens to you, but how you react to it that matters.","author":"Epictetus"},{"quote":"If you want to improve, be content to be thought foolish and stupid.","author":"Epictetus"},{"quote":"How long are you going to wait before you demand the best for yourself and in no instance bypass the discriminations of reason? You have been given the principles that you ought to endorse, and you have endorsed them. What kind of teacher, then, are you still waiting for in order to refer your self-improvement to him? You are no longer a boy, but a full-grown man. If you are careless and lazy now and keep putting things off and always deferring the day after which you will attend to yourself, you will not notice that you are making no progress, but you will live and die as someone quite ordinary.\\nFrom now on, then, resolve to live as a grown-up who is making progress, and make whatever you think best a law that you never set aside. And whenever you encounter anything that is difficult or pleasurable, or highly or lowly regarded, remember that the contest is now: you are at the Olympic Games, you cannot wait any longer, and that your progress is wrecked or preserved by a single day and a single event. That is how Socrates fulfilled himself by attending to nothing except reason in everything he encountered. And you, although you are not yet a Socrates, should live as someone who at least wants to be a Socrates.","author":"Epictetus"},{"quote":"Any person capable of angering you becomes your master;\\nhe can anger you only when you permit yourself to be disturbed by him.","author":"Epictetus"},{"quote":"The key is to keep company only with people who uplift you, whose presence calls forth your best.","author":"Epictetus"},{"quote":"He who laughs at himself never runs out of things to laugh at.","author":"Epictetus"},{"quote":"Freedom is the only worthy goal in life.

If someone succeeds in provoking you, realize that your mind is complicit in the provocation. Which is why it is essential that we not respond impulsively to impressions; take a moment before reacting, and you will find it easier to maintain control.","author":"Epictetus"},{"quote":"You are a little soul carrying around a corpse","author":"Epictetus"},{"quote":"I laugh at those who think they can damage me. They do not know who I am, they do not know what I think, they cannot even touch the things which are really mine and with which I live.","author":"Epictetus"},{"quote":"To accuse others for one\'s own misfortune is a sign of want of education.

Skillful pilots gain their reputation from storms and tempests.

Avoid being one of the mob who indulges in such pastimes. Your life is too short and you have important things to do. Be discriminating about what images and ideas you permit into your mind. If you yourself don\'t choose what thoughts and images you expose yourself to, someone else will, and their motives may not be the highest. It is the easiest thing in the world to slide imperceptibly into vulgarity. But there\'s no need for that to happen if you determine not to waste your time and attention on mindless pap.","author":"Epictetus"},{"quote":"Caretake this moment.

The longer you wait, the more you\u2019ll be vulnerable to mediocrity and feel filled with shame and regret, because you know you are capable of better. From this instant on, vow to stop disappointing yourself. Separate yourself from the mob. Decide to be extraordinary and do what you need to do \u2013 now.","author":"Epictetus"},{"quote":"Don\'t seek to have events happen as you wish, but wish them to happen as they do happen, and all will be well with you.","author":"Epictetus"},{"quote":"Do not try to seem wise to others.

No man is free who is not master of himself. A man should so live that his happiness shall depend as little as possible on external things.

","author":"Epictetus"},{"quote":"You know yourself what you are worth in your own eyes; and at what price you will sell yourself. For men sell themselves at various prices. This is why, when Florus was deliberating whether he should appear at Nero\'s shows, taking part in the performance himself, Agrippinus replied, \'Appear by all means.\' And when Florus inquired, \'But why do not you appear?\' he answered, \'Because I do not even consider the question.\' For the man who has once stooped to consider such questions, and to reckon up the value of external things, is not far from forgetting what manner of man he is.","author":"Epictetus"},{"quote":"Some things are in our control and others not. Things in our control are opinion, pursuit, desire, aversion, and, in a word, whatever are our own actions. Things not in our control are body, property, reputation, command, and, in one word, whatever are not our actions. The things in our control are by nature free, unrestrained, unhindered; but those not in our control are weak, slavish, restrained, belonging to others. Remember, then, that if you suppose that things which are slavish by nature are also free, and that what belongs to others is your own, then you will be hindered. You will lament, you will be disturbed, and you will find fault both with gods and men. But if you suppose that only to be your own which is your own, and what belongs to others such as it really is, then no one will ever compel you or restrain you. Further, you will find fault with no one or accuse no one. You will do nothing against your will. No one will hurt you, you will have no enemies, and you not be harmed.","author":"Epictetus"},{"quote":"If you would be a reader, read; if a writer, write.","author":"Epictetus"},{"quote":"If you want to improve, be content to be thought foolish and stupid with regard to external things. Don\'t wish to be thought to know anything; and even if you appear to be somebody important to others, distrust yourself. For, it is difficult to both keep your faculty of choice in a state conformable to nature, and at the same time acquire external things. But while you are careful about the one, you must of necessity neglect the other","author":"Epictetus"},{"quote":"If you wish to be a writer, write.","author":"Epictetus"},{"quote":"I must die. Must I then die lamenting? I must be put in chains. Must I then also lament? I must go into exile. Does any man then hinder me from going with smiles and cheerfulness and contentment?","author":"Epictetus"},{"quote":"Never depend on the admiration of others. There is no strength in it. Personal merit cannot be derived from an external source. It is not to be found in your personal associations, nor can it be found in the regard of other people. It is a fact of life that other people, even people who love you, will not necessarily agree with your ideas, understand you, or share your enthusiasms. Grow up! Who cares what other people think about you!","author":"Epictetus"},{"quote":"What really frightens and dismays us is not external events themselves, but the way in which we think about them. It is not things that disturb us, but our interpretation of their significance.","author":"Epictetus"},{"quote":"We are not disturbed by what happens to us, but by our thoughts about what happens to us.","author":"Epictetus"},{"quote":"Demand not that things happen as you wish, but wish them to happen as they do, and you will go on well.","author":"Epictetus"},{"quote":"You become what you give your attention to.","author":"Epictetus"},{"quote":"Difficulty shows what men are. Therefore when a difficulty falls upon you, remember that God, like a trainer of wrestlers, has matched you with a rough young man. Why? So that you may become an Olympic conqueror; but it is not accomplished without sweat.","author":"Epictetus"},{"quote":"Events do not just happen, but arrive by appointment.","author":"Epictetus"},{"quote":"It is not so much what happens to you as how you think about what happens.","author":"Epictetus"},{"quote":"Remember that you ought to behave in life as you would at a banquet. As something is being passed around it comes to you; stretch out your hand, take a portion of it politely. It passes on; do not detain it. Or it has not come to you yet; do not project your desire to meet it, but wait until it comes in front of you. So act toward children, so toward a wife, so toward office, so toward wealth.","author":"Epictetus"},{"quote":"Know you not that a good man does nothing for appearance sake, but for the sake of having done right?","author":"Epictetus"},{"quote":"Asked, Who is the rich man? Epictetus replied, \x93He who is content.","author":"Epictetus"},{"quote":"If you would cure anger, do not feed it.

Be one.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"quote":"If you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing itself, but to your estimate of it; and this you have the power to revoke at any moment.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"quote":"When you arise in the morning think of what a privilege it is to be alive, to think, to enjoy, to love ...","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"quote":"The best revenge is to be unlike him who performed the injury.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"quote":"Accept the things to which fate binds you, and love the people with whom fate brings you together,but do so with all your heart.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"quote":"The soul becomes dyed with the colour of its thoughts.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"quote":"It is not death that a man should fear, but he should fear never beginning to live.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"quote":"Never let the future disturb you. You will meet it, if you have to, with the same weapons of reason which today arm you against the present.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"quote":"Our life is what our thoughts make it.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"quote":"If someone is able to show me that what I think or do is not right, I will happily change, for I seek the truth, by which no one was ever truly harmed. It is the person who continues in his self-deception and ignorance who is harmed.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"quote":"I have often wondered how it is that every man loves himself more than all the rest of men, but yet sets less value on his own opinion of himself than on the opinion of others.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"quote":"Whenever you are about to find fault with someone, ask yourself the following question: What fault of mine most nearly resembles the one I am about to criticize?","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"quote":"If it is not right do not do it; if it is not true do not say it.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"quote":"The object of life is not to be on the side of the majority, but to escape finding oneself in the ranks of the insane.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"quote":"Very little is needed to make a happy life; it is all within yourself in your way of thinking.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"quote":"The best revenge is not to be like your enemy.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"quote":"When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: the people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous and surly. They are like this because they can\'t tell good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own - not of the same blood and birth, but the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine. And so none of them can hurt me. No one can implicate me in ugliness. Nor can I feel angry at my relative, or hate him. We were born to work together like feet, hands and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower. To obstruct each other is unnatural. To feel anger at someone, to turn your back on him: these are unnatural.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"quote":"Reject your sense of injury and the injury itself disappears.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"quote":"When another blames you or hates you, or people voice similar criticisms, go to their souls, penetrate inside and see what sort of people they are.

The second is to look things in the face and know them for what they are.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"quote":"How much more grievous are the consequences of anger than the causes of it.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"quote":"Do not act as if you were going to live ten thousand years. Death hangs over you. While you live, while it is in your power, be good.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"quote":"Live a good life. If there are gods and they are just, then they will not care how devout you have been, but will welcome you based on the virtues you have lived by. If there are gods, but unjust, then you should not want to worship them. If there are no gods, then you will be gone, but will have lived a noble life that will live on in the memories of your loved ones.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"quote":"Look well into thyself; there is a source of strength which will always spring up if thou wilt always look.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"quote":"How much time he gains who does not look to see what his neighbour says or does or thinks, but only at what he does himself, to make it just and holy.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"quote":"Begin each day by telling yourself: Today I shall be meeting with interference, ingratitude, insolence, disloyalty, ill-will, and selfishness \u2013 all of them due to the offenders\u2019 ignorance of what is good or evil.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"quote":"You are a little soul carrying about a corpse, as Epictetus used to say.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"quote":"Think of yourself as dead.

But this is altogether a mark of the most common sort of men, for it is in thy power whenever thou shalt choose to retire into thyself. For nowhere either with more quiet or more freedom from trouble does a man retire than into his own soul, particularly when he has within him such thoughts that by looking into them he is immediately in perfect tranquility; and I affirm that tranquility is nothing else than the good ordering of the mind. Constantly then give to thyself this retreat, and renew thyself; and let thy principles be brief and fundamental, which, as soon as thou shalt recur to them, will be sufficient to cleanse the soul completely, and to send thee back free from all discontent with the things to which thou returnest. For with what art thou discontented? With the badness of men? Recall to thy mind this conclusion, that rational animals exist for one another, and that to endure is a part of justice, and that men do wrong involuntarily; and consider how many already, after mutual enmity, suspicion, hatred, and fighting, have been stretched dead, reduced to ashes; and be quiet at last.- But perhaps thou art dissatisfied with that which is assigned to thee out of the universe.- Recall to thy recollection this alternative; either there is providence or atoms, fortuitous concurrence of things; or remember the arguments by which it has been proved that the world is a kind of political community, and be quiet at last.- But perhaps corporeal things will still fasten upon thee.- Consider then further that the mind mingles not with the breath, whether moving gently or violently, when it has once drawn itself apart and discovered its own power, and think also of all that thou hast heard and assented to about pain and pleasure, and be quiet at last.- But perhaps the desire of the thing called fame will torment thee.- See how soon everything is forgotten, and look at the chaos of infinite time on each side of the present, and the emptiness of applause, and the changeableness and want of judgement in those who pretend to give praise, and the narrowness of the space within which it is circumscribed, and be quiet at last.
